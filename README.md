# auction_app

#Step 1

Packages: 
1. For Login using gmail I have used the firebase_auth package 

Challenges:
1. This was comperatively easy task. Though I wanted to use Getx for the authentication and google_sign_in, but in the end I choose the option which seemed better for me. 


#Step2

packages: 
1. cloud_firestore
2. firebase_core

Challenges: 
1. This step was a long step where I has to show all the posts and their details in the gallery page along with auction page when pressed "Bid" option. 
2. For taking input or create a post I used stepper and the UI was good. But the main challenge for me was to take photo as input which I unfortunatly could not implement. 
3. All the connections with firebase was also time consuming but I figuered out to implement and read and set data from and to firebase using firebase cloud store.
4. This part was fun


#Step3

Challenges:
1. Users were able to place bids and the page refresed to show the newly added bids. If pressed on place a bid option, it also takes to the auction oage where all the details of the auction product and bid history is shown
2. The edit option was not able to be implemented. 
3. I faced challenges in implimenting specific aution pages for each post which I then implemented using firebase. 


#Step4

Challenges:
I was not able to set time for each posts and bids. I tried a lot of options but few of them worked properly


#Step5
I tried to make the UI as beautiful as possible

#step6
The apk file : 


#step7
At last I made a dashboard which shows all the running bids, total amount of posts, bids that are completed and bid value. Unfortunately the completed bids was not implemented, since I faced problems with the bid time ending. But I solved the probles faced while retrieveing all the required datas to implement the options of the dashboard.
